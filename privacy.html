        <dt>Add or remove accounts</dt>
        <dt>Create accounts and set passwords</dt>
        <dt>Find accounts on the device</dt>
        <dd>SeriesGuide creates an account to integrate with the Android sync framework and to store your trakt credentials. You can have a look at it in Android Settings > Accounts.</dd>
        </br>
        <dt>Google Play billing service</dt>
        <dd>SeriesGuide provides an <a href="whypay">in-app purchase to unlock all features</a>. This is handled by Google Play.</dd>
        </br>
        <dt>Full network access</dt>
        <dd>SeriesGuide needs to download information from its data sources to display them inside the app (from TheTVDB, TMDb and trakt). Also integration with trakt or SeriesGuide Cloud requires an internet connection.</dd>
        </br>
        <dt>Control Near Field Communication (NFC)</dt>
        <dd>SeriesGuide allows you to beam a show to another device (open a show overview, then tap two devices together) using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Beam">Android Beam</a>, which requires NFC.</dd>
        </br>
        <dt>Modify or delete the contents of your USB storage</dt>
        <dt>Test access to protected storage</dt>
        <dd>The <a href="help#backup">Backup/Restore</a> tool as well as <a href="help#autobackup">Auto-Backup</a> write and read their files from your external storage (USB/SD card/integrated).</dd>
        </br>
        <dt>View network connections</dt>
        <dd>SeriesGuide has the option to only download images over WiFi and needs to behave well if you are offline. So it needs to check which, if any, connections are currently available.</dd>
        </br>
        <dt>Control vibration</dt>
        <dd>SeriesGuide can show notifications, these can be set to vibrate.</dd>
        </br>
        <dt>Prevent phone from sleeping</dt>
        <dd>SeriesGuide listens when an extension is uninstalled or updated so it can remove or update it. While reacting to such a change, SeriesGuide needs to ensure your device does not go to sleep in the middle of it.</dd>
        </br>
        <dt>Run at startup</dt>
        <dd>SeriesGuide can show notifications, so at startup it makes sure that the notification service is re-scheduled to wake up for the next one. This is delayed so it will not slow down your boot process.</dd>
        </br>
        <dt>Read sync statistics</dt>
        <dt>Read sync settings</dt>
        <dt>Toggle sync on and off</dt>
        <dd>SeriesGuide integrates with the Android sync framework for content updates (see Settings > Basics > Auto-Update and Android Settings > Accounts). This allows to toggle sync within the app and see if an update is currently running.</dd>
        </br>
        <dt>Install shortcuts</dt>
        <dd>From a show overview page you can create a shortcut. SeriesGuide needs this permission to automatically add it to your home screen.</dd>
