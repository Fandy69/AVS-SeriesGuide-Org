    <h3>Regular Updates and Features</h3>
    <p>SeriesGuide is developed as and built upon <strong>open source</strong> software and all but some convenience features are available for free. If you really like it, paying for it will <strong>help me make future features and fixes</strong>.</p>
    <p>However, you can also help by <a href="{{ site.data.links.community }}">sending in feedback</a>, <a href="{{ site.data.links.crowdin }}">translating on crowdin</a> or even <a href="{{ site.data.links.github }}">forking the code</a> and adding features. SeriesGuide would not exist without its community!</p>

    <h3>Episode notifications</h3>
    <p>Get notifications for upcoming episodes.</p>

    <h3>More list widget options</h3>
